1) Only static case is treated.
2) Features are not tracked to go out of view.
3) State is corrected after regular number of camera Poses.

The velocities given in the dataset must have been integrated with better accuracy within. There is a huge drift in the integrated velocity in comparison to the velocity in the dataset.
Also, the major difference between the integrated positions was due to the fact that the vehicle in the dataset had initial velocity which was considered zero in integration.
The battle of filters paper was not able to truly correct because they treated velocity as with the random noise, but was not.

At no of points of extraction = 60, it gives good result, but as I increase the no of points, it bumps to 70 in y?
